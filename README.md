## RESUME 
Our purpose is to show the growth of people's interest in the feminist movement through graphics, obtaining data from Instagram accounts that are dedicated to providing information about it, through the use of a distributed system, using the  knowledge from the subject.<br/>
This project is supported by the interest in developing a space that allows the person to use this information for some type of research, to acquire resources that help them build a position with foundations towards this issue. <br/>
## RESOURCES
We provide a list of links to informative instagram accounts that are experts on the subject with which we plan to work. More will be added or some will be deleted, it all depends on the development of the project..
